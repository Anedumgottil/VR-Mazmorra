Things I will try to get done for this project by Friday


Target: --------------------- 
	
 + Try to get the GridSpace class built: Requires us to generate 8 block prefabs or tile prefabs and place/orient them correctly inside this GridSpace, for every section of map [8]
	- Areas of the map need to make walls if they don't immediately have tiles surrounding them, no holes to outside the map, etc [2]
	
 + We need the SteamVR API to be integrated into the application [3]
	- This may be a pain if we run into any difficulties setting up the rig, might take some time [2]
	- Will need testing to make sure the player is at the appropriate height and cannot fall through the floor, etc. [1]

 + Close my ticket on the GitHub repo by completing it.
