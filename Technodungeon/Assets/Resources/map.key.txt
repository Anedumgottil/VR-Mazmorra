The order that you put the Block ID's into the map per GridSpace is defined using the standard ordering.
They are loaded in one at a time, with the first ID being the 0th position, and the last ID being the 7th position.
We use this ordering for everything, there even exists an enum in GridSpace that shows this:

public enum GridPos : byte {LoNW = 0, LoSW = 1, LoNE = 2, LoSE = 3, HiNW = 4, HiSW = 5, HiNE = 6, HiSE = 7};//8 blocks per grid, with cardinal positions defined here
    //you'll notice: index >= 4 , guaranteed to be higher block
    //               index % 2 == 0, guaranteed to be northern block
    //               and vice versa.
