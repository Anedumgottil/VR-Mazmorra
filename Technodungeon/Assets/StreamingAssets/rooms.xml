<!-- Specify here collections of GridSpaceConfigurations and GridSpace Coordinates that will define the types of GridSpaces in a given Room -->
<!-- You can specify a GSconfig index in a <gridspace /> element to force a GridSpace to be a certain arrangement in a room, at least until it's updated by a setGridSpace call or something -->
<!-- A value of -1 for a <gridspace /> config attribute will specify that you would rather have the MapGenerator decide based on context, and you don't care about what it gets set to. useful if you're lazy. -->
<!-- You can also specify a list of Entity's, with a Grid Coord and a name, as well as a local positional offset (relative to the GridSpace they get assigned to) to spawn in Entities at the start of the game. -->

<!-- We really really really really need a way to automate the generation of these files. That's one of the reason I have switched us to XML. But this may require serialization of our classes. -->
