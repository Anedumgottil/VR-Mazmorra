Things I will try to get done for this project by Friday


Target: --------------------- What was said on our presentation design goals:
Func. Min. - Map tiles spawned by a script, 2d gridview for the second player that can spawn in the map tiles using said script.

 + We need the current Grid system to be refactored to hold both Map Tiles as well as the current Block system
	
 + Try to get the GridSpace class built: Requires us to generate 8 block prefabs or tile prefabs and place/orient them correctly inside this GridSpace, for every section of map
	- Areas of the map need to make walls if they don't immediately have tiles surrounding them, no holes to outside the map, etc
	
 + We need the SteamVR API to be integrated into the application
	- This may be a pain if we run into any difficulties setting up the rig, might take some time
	- Will need testing to make sure the player is at the appropriate height and cannot fall through the floor, etc.

 + Close my ticket on the GitHub repo by completing it.
